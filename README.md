#Fish Stocking Map

##Project URL
http://s3.amazonaws.com/vt-stock-exchange/index

##Overview
This project takes fish stocking data published by the Vermont [Department of Fish and Wildlife](http://vtfishandwildlife.com) to create an interactive map to navigate the data.

The published data on stocking includes:

- Number of fish
- Species
- Town
- Average size
- Body of water
- Age of fish
- Date stocked

##\#CodeForBTV
This project was a part of the first [\#CodeForBTV](http://codeforbtv.org/) event. \#CodeForBTV took place on June 1-2, 2013 as a part of the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/).

##Future Plans

###Fish Stocking Map

- The map could be further improved by a date filter that allows users to see when the fish were stocked.
- A map layer including VT surface waters would be interesting.
- Automate data upload.

###Plug and Chug VT Map
This project could be used as a template to create interactive maps of the state of Vermont organized by town. A better base map would be helpful, possibly using older census data.
